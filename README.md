Postgresql_Assignment, this assignment for Implementing the schema, inserting dummy data in each table and write query to show that total order price for each user . So, expected the result like the following :

      [  user_name , order_id , total price
        Ahmed     , 1        , 1000 ]
  
that means user ahmed bought many items in one order and when we sum the price for each order item (which maps to a certain product) the total order price is 1000.
